# Kentucky School/District Report Cards
Stata project for cleaning, formatting, and optimizing the storage of data from the [Kentucky School Report Cards](https://applications.education.ky.gov/src/DataSets.aspx).  The goal is to automate the processing across files and implement a consistent schema and naming conventions across files to allow the data to be stored and accessed in a more sustainable manner.
