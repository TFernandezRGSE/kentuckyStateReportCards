# Kentucky School/District Report Cards
Stata project for cleaning, formatting, and optimizing the storage of data from the [Kentucky School Report Cards](https://applications.education.ky.gov/src/DataSets.aspx).  The goal is to automate the processing across files and implement a consistent schema and naming conventions across files to allow the data to be stored and accessed in a more sustainable manner.

# Issues
Given the upcoming and anticipated changes to Kentucky's accountability system/framework, no additional development work is scheduled for the current platform.  Unfortunately, this means there may be cases where some data are mislabeled/coded due to the unavailability of metadata on the application website.  However, if a bug is found, we'd like to ask you to submit an issue - including a reproducible error - so we may track it down and apply the appropriate fixes necessary.
