# Kentucky School/District Report Cards
Stata project for cleaning, formatting, and optimizing the storage of data from the [Kentucky School Report Cards](https://applications.education.ky.gov/src/DataSets.aspx).  The goal is to automate the processing across files and implement a consistent schema and naming conventions across files to allow the data to be stored and accessed in a more sustainable manner.

# Data Quality Issues/Concerns
There are numerous instances where the files released by KDE contain significant inconsistencies, undocumented changes, and seemingly invalid values (e.g., a grade level of "Entry" or "EO", etc...).  We are continuing to request documentation that should be provided with the files from KDE, but have yet to receive any of the documentation we would need to truly handle all these issues in a consistent manner.  With that said, we expect that there will be errors that we are unable to address due to these issues.  However, if anyone has access to any documentation that would aid us in deciphering some of these issues we would greatly appreciate any assistance you could provide.
